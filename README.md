# JavaScript Backend Curriculum

## Variables
Variables are memory locations that store values.

## Values
Values are entities manipulated, changed, or used to create other values.
   - Example: "Honda" can be the value of the car variable.

## Data Types
Data types represent specific categories of values.
   - Example: Number, string, boolean, and others.

## Math Operators
Operators are symbols that facilitate mathematical operations.
   - Example: *, -, !, +.

## Logical Operators
Operators are symbols that facilitate logical operations.
   - Example: !, &&, ||.
     
## Conditional || Controll Flow
Conditional control flow in JavaScript involves making decisions in your code based on certain conditions. It allows your program to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a given condition is true or false.

## Loops
Loops involve repeating tasks in the same sequence under specific conditions.
   - Example: For-loop, while-loop, do-while-loop.

## Functions
Functions are blocks of code designed for repetitive execution.
   - **Declaration**
   - **Invocation**
   - **Parameters and Arguments**
   - **Return Statement**
   - **Expression**
   - **Arrow Function**
   - **Anonymous**
   - **Hoisting**
   - **Callback**
   - **Methods**
   - **Recursion**
   - **Rest and Spread**

## Async
Async deals with concurrency in asynchronous programming.
   - Understand asynchronous programming, callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax.
   - Learn how to handle asynchronous tasks, such as fetching data from APIs.

## ES6+ Features
ES6+ introduces arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, and classes.

## OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
OOP signifies that everything is an object.
   - Learn basics, including object creation, inheritance, and encapsulation.
   - Understand prototypes and prototype inheritance.

## Web APIs
Web APIs provide a standardized way for different software systems to communicate over the web.

## Library
A library is a collection of pre-written code that can be used in your program.
   - Example: Moment, Axios, etc.

## Frameworks and Libraries
Frameworks are comprehensive sets of tools and rules designed to structure and guide the development of a particular type of software.
   - Example: Nestjs, Express, Fastify.

## Node.js
Learn server-side development with Node.js.
   - Understand how to use npm (Node Package Manager) to manage dependencies.

## Version Control
Version control systems such as Git and GitHub enable efficient collaboration and code management.

## Database
A database is a structured collection of data organized for efficient storage, retrieval, and management.
   - **Relational**
   - **NoSQL**
   - **Driver**
   - **CRUD Operations**
   - **Asynchronous Nature**
   - **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)**
   - **Models**
   - **Model Relationship**

## Debugging
Debugging is the art of finding and fixing problems in the code.

## Formatting
Formatting involves beautifying the code for improved readability.

## Testing
Testing is crucial and should be conducted at various levels to ensure code reliability.

## Environment
The programming environment specifies the context of development, such as dev, staging, and prod.
